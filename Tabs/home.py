    st.markdown('''Steel quality is influenced by a multitude of factors spanning its production process and inherent composition. Firstly, raw materials play a pivotal role; the type and purity of iron ore, along with additional elements like manganese, nickel, and chromium, impact the steel's final properties. The manufacturing process, including refining techniques, temperature control, and alloying methods, profoundly affects steel quality. Heat treatment processes, such as quenching and tempering, alter the steel\'s internal structure, enhancing its strength and durability.Moreover, external environmental factors during production, such as humidity and temperature, can affect the steel's characteristics. The presence of impurities like sulfur and phosphorus can lead to brittleness, affecting its overall quality. Furthermore, the expertise and precision of the workforce involved in the manufacturing process are critical; skilled labor and adherence to stringent quality control measures ensure consistency and high standards in steel production. Ultimately, factors such as raw material quality, manufacturing processes, environmental conditions, and human expertise collectively determine the quality, strength, and usability of the final steel product.''')
